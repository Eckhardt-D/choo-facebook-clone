## Choo.js is a small 4kb frontend framework
This repo is an example app where you can create non-persistent posts. Each post has a like counter (It's infinitely likeable and can have negative likes [lazy dev])

### Just for fun
Built for a Youtube video as part of FFF (Frontend Framework Friday).

It demonstrates:
- components
- layouts
- state
- mutating state
- and the general flexibility of the framework

### Uses parcel to bundle files

```bash
npm start #spins up a server on localhost:1234
```
